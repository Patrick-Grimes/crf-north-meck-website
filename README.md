🤝 Team Collaboration & My Role

This dashboard was built collaboratively during the Davidson College Community Research Fellows (CRF) program. 
While the final codebase and deployment were managed and committed by my teammate, I was responsible for:

Data Engineering: Building the reproducible R-based data pipelines to ingest and clean the American Community Survey (ACS) data.

Spatial Analysis: Performing the spatial joins with sf and implementing the weighted aggregations for the custom planning geographies.

Visualization: Designing the core analytical logic that powers the interactive Shiny and Leaflet map components.
